# Week One Homework
## Part 1: Site Inspiration
[New York Magazine](http://nymag.com/): This site is actually a big 'don't' for how I want my site's layout to look. The organization of content is very crowded and I don't feel that there's enough whitespace.

[Who What Wear](http://www.whowhatwear.com/): Two things I like about this site are the typography and the emphasis on photography. Since I'm designing for an academic fashion journal, I think the presentation of photography is a key element of the overall design I want to come up with.

[The Journal of Retail Image](http://www.whowhatwear.com/): This is the current website that I will be redesigning. The site looks horribly outdated in my opinion. I think that there's too much going on with the color scheme and the various fonts. The journal should have a proprietary logo (which I will also be designing) and the layout to read current articles should be more intuitive. I also feel that there are too many fonts being used, so those should be pared down too.

## Part 2: Content Inventory
*About Me*

Since my ideas for IDM 221 and IDM 222 include redesigning websites that already exist (The Journal of Retail Image and my own blog) I actually have plenty of content to work with already. Instead, I'll tell you a little bit about myself as a student and a designer.

I'm a design and merchandising major with an interactive digital media minor. I originally entered Drexel as a business major and changed majors within LeBow several times before realizing that I wanted a more engaging major in the summer following my sophomore year.

As you may have ascertained from my site inspiration commentary, my design philosophy really is "less is more". I believe that in media, content should be able to speak for itself and a great website should complement the content it frames. I haven't had the chance to design a minimalist website yet, but I think that the redesign of The Journal would be a great opportunity for me to do so.

My professional website, [Jenna Adrian Creative](jennaadriancreative.com) details my professional experience and published journalism, while my blog, [and some like it haute](www.andsomelikeithaute.com) is a more creative outlet.

Additional fun facts about me are as follows:
* I don't get along well with cats
* I have four tattoos
* I am equal parts intrigued and disgusted by the thought of running a marathon.
* *The Beautiful and The Damned* is on my reading list
